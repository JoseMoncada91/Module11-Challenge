Mars Weather Analysis by Jose Moncada (11/26/2024)
This project focuses on analyzing weather data from Mars, collected by NASA's Curiosity Rover. Using Python and the Pandas library, it performs data analysis and visualization to estimate Martian year length, assess temperature and atmospheric pressure patterns, and visualize weather trends on Mars.
The project demonstrates proficiency in data analysis, visualization, and understanding Martian weather conditions.

Overview
Key objectives of the project include:

Data Analysis:

Explored a dataset of weather data from Mars, focusing on the minimum temperature and atmospheric pressure recorded by the Curiosity Rover.
Analyzed trends in temperature and pressure by month, and visually estimated the length of a Martian year.
Visualizations:

Plotted monthly averages for minimum temperature and atmospheric pressure.
Identified the coldest and hottest months for temperature, as well as the highest and lowest pressure months.
Martian Year Estimation:

Estimated the number of terrestrial (Earth) days in a Martian year by analyzing the Martian solar longitude (ls).
Visually validated the Martian year length through cumulative Earth days plotted against temperature data.
ChatGPT Support:

News Section: Utilized ChatGPT to support printing the list of weather stations and data points.
Weather Section: Used ChatGPT to help refine the calculation of terrestrial day differences, leading to a more accurate Martian year estimation.

Project Structure
Data: Weather data from the Mars Curiosity Rover is loaded from a CSV file.
Analysis: Python code that uses Pandas for data cleaning, analysis, and calculations.
Visualizations: Matplotlib is used to create plots for temperature, pressure, and Martian year estimations.
Features
Monthly Averages:

Average minimum temperature by month.
Average atmospheric pressure by month.
Martian Year Length Calculation:

Estimated Martian year length based on solar longitude.
Cumulative days plotted to visually estimate the Martian year.
Data Export:

The final dataset is exported as a CSV file (mars_weather_data.csv), which contains the cleaned and analyzed weather data.

Technologies Used
Python: Programming language used for data analysis and visualization.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib: For visualizing temperature and pressure trends.
Jupyter Notebook: For running the code and displaying results.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the ability to analyze and visualize Martian weather data, as well as estimate the length of a Martian year. By performing various data manipulation tasks, creating insightful visualizations, and estimating planetary data, this project contributes to understanding the weather patterns on Mars.

Additionally, ChatGPT was used to enhance the functionality and accuracy of the calculations and data presentation throughout the project
